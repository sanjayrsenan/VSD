## Week-0
### Summary
 The Week 0 lecture discuss about a basic flow of a chip design. The first step in it is the chip modeling where we model the specs and test the applications. Next we do the RTL architect of the chip using HDLs like verilog. 
In soc design flow the rtl code is divided into Processor and Peripherals/IPs.
